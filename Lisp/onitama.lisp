;;STRUCTURES

;;A game structure consists of a win state, a side card, move records, and who
;;the active player is
(defstruct game win-state side-card history active-player
  side-starting-card player-1-starting-cards player-2-starting-cards)

;;A player structure consists of a color (red and blue), list of pawn coordinates,
;;the coordinates of the master piece,
;;the cards in the player's hand, the active card selected for a move
;;(i.e. the tiger card will be applied to a piece),
;;and the type of strategy (human player, random,  AI)
(defstruct player color direction pawns master master-position pieces current-cards strategy)

;;A card structure consists of a name, color, and rules
(defstruct card name color rules)

;;PARAMETERS

;;
;;These card parameters are the  coordinate shifts corresponding to a different
;;animal-themed card.
;;The coordinates of these cards are applied to a tile to create the possible
;;moves available for that tile.
;;(i.e., if a boar card ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1)) is applied to
;;coordinate (3, 3), the possible moves for it are (4, 3), (2, 3) and (3, 4).
